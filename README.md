## **GroupChat**

[Download Starter Code](https://curric.springboard.com/software-engineering-career-track/default/exercises/websocket-groupchat.zip)

GroupChat is an Express-based app that uses websocks for a live, multi-room chat system.

In this exercise, you’ll explore good OO design for more sophisticated applications, as well as get some hands-on practice with websockets. The goal of this exercise is to read and understand the code, if you’d like, there are some additional features you can implement.

**We provide working code to you; the exercise is both to explore this code and add some new features, listed at the end.**

## **Trying Out The App**

```bash
$node server.js
```

Then go to http://localhost:3000/room-name. You can use any room name you want — so you can go to “/random” or “/humor” or “/library” or such — each of these will be a different room with different possible users.

Open a second tab on the same computer and visit the same room, and you should be able to chat with each other.
